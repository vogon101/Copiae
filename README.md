# Copiae V0.1
##Intro
###Scala based game enjine
This game enjine is made in scala using LWJGL for the rendering. It contains utilities for many basic functions that one would not want to keep writing out

This is version 0.1 of the game enjine and will not be updated from now except for the game example and critical bug fixes

##Notes
> See the TestWorld and TestWorld2 classes to see how a game might be made. 

######

> If overriding any methods it would probably be best to call super.method()
